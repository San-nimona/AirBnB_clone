# AirBnB Clone

## Description
The first phase of a four phase project, where I create a basic clone of the AirBnB web app. A basic console was created using the Cmd Python module, to manage the objects of the whole project, being able to implement the methods create, show, update, all, and destroy to the existing classes and subclasses.

## Requirements
Knowledge in python3, how to use a command line interpreter, a computer with Ubuntu 14.04+, python3 and pep8 style corrector.
